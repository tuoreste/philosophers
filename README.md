# Project: Philosophers

## Overview

This project simulates a classic problem known as the "Dining Philosophers Problem." The scenario involves several philosophers sitting at a round table, engaging in the activities of eating, thinking, and sleeping. The goal is to ensure that each philosopher can eat without starving and that the simulation continues until one philosopher succumbs to starvation.

## Rules of the Simulation

1. **Philosophers and Table Setup:**
   - One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
   - A large bowl of spaghetti is placed in the middle of the table.

2. **Philosopher Activities:**
   - Philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping.
   - While eating, they do not think or sleep.
   - While thinking, they do not eat or sleep.
   - While sleeping, they do not eat or think.

3. **Forks on the Table:**
   - There are as many forks on the table as there are philosophers.
   - Philosophers use both their right and left forks to eat, holding one in each hand.

4. **Transition between Activities:**
   - After finishing eating, philosophers place their forks back on the table and start sleeping.
   - Once awake, they resume thinking.
   - The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.

5. **Survival of Philosophers:**
   - Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
   - Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
   - Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.

6. **Avoiding Death:**
   - Philosophers should avoid dying to maintain the simulation.

## Implementation Details

The simulation can be implemented using various synchronization techniques, such as mutexes or semaphores, to ensure proper coordination between philosophers. The programming language and specific implementation details are left open-ended, allowing contributors to choose the most suitable approach.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile and execute the program.
